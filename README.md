# Github Browser
This is a simple app that consumes GIthub's API
and provides a listing of all users
with the ability to show details for each user.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup

`$ yarn install`

`$ yarn start`

## TODO list

- Add browsing capabilites (with arrows) while in UserDetails mode (see next / see prev)
- Remember scrolling position when going back to listing
- Create HOC for showing Loader
